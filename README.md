# hello-world
This is my first apparition in github

Hi, my name is Pedro! This is my first time using github although I'm not a total begginer in coding (I'm sort of a begginer)
I've learned C, Java, and a little web coding too! (CSS, HTML5, JS) 
POO is running in my veins and I'm really excited to start posting my projects here since I'm working in one.

 A curiousity about me, I was a competitive basketball player, and travelled acros my country. Sadly it didn't work out
 But I've found something that is my passion: CODING
